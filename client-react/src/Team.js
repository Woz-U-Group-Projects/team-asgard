                    Hi my name is Len Rundblad, but most people call me Lenny. I'm a Michigan native and moved to Chicago where I earned my BFA in Game Design. During my job search I quickly realized the need for developers, not just in the gaming industry, but in pretty much every industry imaginable. This launched me into exploring alternative career paths that involved coding, which then led me to become a Full-Stack developer.
